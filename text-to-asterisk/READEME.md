Part one of a first year project at uni. The project was to create a program that would take in a character from the user and print out the character in asterisks. 

I stored the fgets function my 'banner' variable in order to take in the users input.
I stored my characters in 2D arrays that could be called upon when the user in putted a character. For example:

If a user inputs character A my pragram will print

```
   *****
   *   *
   *   *
   *****
   *   *
   *   *
   *   *
```

The program calls upon these arrays through a variable in my switch statement called 'characters' and prints the variables using the print function. The switch statement will lookup the user input using the case function which allows me to define which character corresponds with which variable.
